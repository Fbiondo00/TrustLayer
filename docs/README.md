## The 30-second pitch

TrustLayer is a **trust scoring engine** for AI agents that interact with crypto wallets. Before you connect your wallet to any AI agent, TrustLayer runs an 8-step mechanical pipeline (Slither + Dedaub + permission mapping + TX history + wallet approvals + AI intent) on the contract behind the agent and produces a weighted A+ → F grade.

**Mechanical first, AI explains.** Detection runs on deterministic tools. AI only translates findings into plain English.

## Verified targets

The scanner reproduces these grades deterministically:

| Input | Score | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| `MaliciousAgent.sol` (local demo) | 20/100 | F |
| `SafeAgent.sol` (local demo) | 97/100 | A+ |
| USDC mainnet | 83/100 | B+ |
| WETH mainnet | 100/100 | A+ |
| LINK mainnet | 90/100 | A- |

The two demo fixtures need no env keys — open `/scanner`, click **Try MaliciousAgent** or **Try SafeAgent**, click **Scan**.
